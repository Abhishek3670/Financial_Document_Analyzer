## 1. Project Overview

The Financial Document Analyzer is a sophisticated AI-powered system that analyzes financial documents (primarily PDFs) and provides comprehensive investment recommendations, risk assessments, and financial insights. The system uses CrewAI agents with specialized roles to process documents and generate detailed analyses.

## 2. Architecture Overview

### Backend (FastAPI)
The backend is built with FastAPI and follows a clean architecture pattern with the following key components:

1. Core Layer:
   - agents.py - Defines specialized AI agents for different analysis tasks
   - task.py - Defines tasks that agents perform
   - database.py - Database connection and session management

2. Models:
   - models.py - SQLAlchemy database models and Pydantic response models

3. Services:
   - services.py - Business logic layer implementing CRUD operations

4. Authentication:
   - auth.py - Authentication service with JWT tokens
   - auth_middleware.py - Authentication middleware

5. Utilities:
   - tools.py - Custom tools for agents (PDF reading, financial analysis, etc.)
   - redis_cache.py - Caching layer for performance optimization
   - llm_observability.py - LLM usage tracking and monitoring
   - file_manager.py - File management utilities

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
The frontend is a React application with TypeScript that provides a user interface for:
- Uploading financial documents
- Viewing analysis results
- Managing analysis history
- User authentication
